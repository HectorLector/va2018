Overview of Text Visualization Techniques
With the every growing amount of information contained in text document collections, it is
imperative to allow the user to easily understand, search and explore the given information
with the help of text visualization techniques.
In this Report, we want to give a short overview of the different text visualization techniques
described in this book 1. The authors group the various visualization techniques regarding
their goal into five distinct categories:
●
●
●
●
●

Visualizing document similarity
Revealing content
Visualizing sentiments and emotions of the text
Exploring document corpus
Analyzing various domain-specific rich-text corpus (Social media, news, emails etc.)

We will introduce and describe each category briefly and give an example of an interesting
tool, which solves the specified task well.
An interactive list of over 400 different text visualization techniques, can be found here 2.
This Text Visualization Browser is one of the most complete collections for visualization
techniques over the last decades.

Visualizing Document Similarity
One of the most common technique is to represent content similarities at the document level.
Documents are usually represented as points in 2 or 3-dimensional space. The distance
between the points describes the similarity of the corresponding documents. We can
distinguish two different similarity techniques:
1. Projection-oriented
2. Semantic-oriented

Projection Oriented Techniques
In these techniques the content is split into a list of words, to create a n-dimensional feature
vector, based on the most informative words. This is calculated by using “Term Frequency
Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)”. Some common pre-processing tasks are also used
to increase accuracy and performance, such as: removal of stopwords, stemming etc.
The resulting feature vector is then visualized by means of a dimensionality reduction
algorithm. Common linear algorithms are “Principal Component Analysis (PCA)” or “Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA)”. Non-linear algorithms include “Multidimensional Scaling
(MDS)” and “Locally Linear embedding (LLE)”.

Semantic Oriented Techniques
These approaches concentrate on expressing similarities between documents based on
their underlying topics. Common algorithms in this field include: “Probabilistic Latent
Semantic Analysis (PLSA)”, “Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)”, “Spherical Topic Model
(SAM)”, and “Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)”.
Use Cases for this algorithms are mostly designed for analytical tasks and not for
visualization, so their output may not be used directly. Still, compared to the projection
oriented techniques, semantic based approaches can create more sensible results that user
can easily understand.

Revealing content
The goal here is to visually represent the content of text documents. A single document can
be summarized by two aspects: its content (words, sentences etc.) or its structure and
metadata (average sentence length, word count, statistics etc.)
Interestings Projects for those tasks include the following:
●
●

Wordle: A state-of-the-art Tag Cloud implementation.
Document fingerprint: A heatmap where each cell represents a text block, with the
feature value encoded as color (for example average sentence length).

Visualizing Sentiments and Emotions
Different techniques have been invented to visualize the change of sentiments over time.
Some common examples include the sentiment analysis of twitter feeds regarding a specific
topic over time. One basic approach is to simple draw a time-series diagram, where the
changes in sentiments are shown on the y-axis. To address the shortcomings of this
approach (why and how exactly did the sentiment changed), more sophisticated techniques
are used. Interesting tools in this section are:
●
●

EmotionWatch: Classify users’ emotional reactions to public events overtime in a
radar diagram.
Pulse: Visualize the topic/sentiment of large amounts of customer feedback, to
examine opinions at a glance.

Document Exploration Techniques
The large part of our report focussed on document exploration. The goal here is to allow the
user to navigate large document collections, discover patterns and gain useful information.
Document exploration techniques can be split into four different categories.

Distortion Based Approaches
In this technique the focused part of the document is shown prominently in the view center,
while the rest is distorted (blurred, smaller size, different shade). Early examples include
“Document Lens” and “Data Mountain”.

Exploration Based on Document Similarity
Here full document collections are visualized in a multi coordinated view, based on their
similarity. Users can navigate and interact with this collection by zooming and panning,

resulting in different levels of details.Examples for such systems are “InfoSky” and
“ForceSPIRE”

Hierarchical Document Exploration
Documents are clustered based on their similarity and hierarchically shown in a tree-like
structure.

Search and Query Based Approaches
A classic approach, where the large amounts of documents are handled by reducing the
displayed information via queries and filter. The result is ranked after various criterias and
the users can navigate through different views to get exactly the information they need.
Views are usually connected interactively, so changing on parameter also effects all the
other views. This technique is called “Linking and Brushing”.

Conclusion
We briefly explained various text visualization techniques, based on their overall goal. Many
different implementations already exists. For a comprehensive overview with over 400
examples, visit the Text Visualization Browser.
