Overview of Text Visualization Techniques

Abstract The increasing availability of electronic document archives, such as webpages, online news sites, blogs, and various publications and articles, provides an
unprecedented amount of information. This situation introduces a new challenge,
which is the discovery of useful knowledge from large document collections effectively without completely going through the details of each document in the collection. Information visualization techniques provide a convenient means to summarize
documents in visual forms that allow users to fully understand and memorize data
insights. In turn, this process facilitates data comparison and pattern recognition.
Many text visualization techniques have been extensively studied and developed for
different purposes since the 1990s. In this chapter, we briefly review these techniques
to provide an overview of text visualization. Our survey is based on studies summarized in the online text visualization browser (http://textvis.lnu.se/). We classify
different text visualization techniques regarding their design goals, which largely
group existing techniques into five categories. These categories include techniques
developed (1) for visualizing document similarity, (2) for revealing content, (3) for
visualizing sentiments and emotions of the text, (4) for exploring document corpus,
and (5) for analyzing various domain-specific rich-text corpus, such as social media
data, online news, emails, poetry, and prose. Based on this taxonomy, we introduce
the details of the primary text visualization research topics in the following chapters
of this book.

2.1 Review Scope and Taxonomy
In this book, we have reviewed over 200 papers summarized in the Text Visualization
Browser [61] (Fig. 2.1), which was developed by the ISOVIS Research Group from
Linnaeus University in Sweden. This online tool provides the most comprehensive
and up-to-date summary of text visualization that has been published. This browser
enables a user to filter these techniques interactively according to tasks, data, application domain, and visual design styles, which greatly support the writing of this
book, especially this chapter.

Among all the studies listed in the Text Visualization Browser, a set of 120 core
text visualization papers were reviewed; these were published in key conferences
and journals in three different but highly related areas, namely, visualization, data
mining, and human-computer interaction. In particular, our review focuses on the
related papers published in (1) visualization-related conferences and journals, such
as IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization, IEEE International
Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology, IEEE Transactions on
Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications,
Computer Graphics Forum, and Information Visualization; (2) data mining-related
conferences and journals, such as ACM sigKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,
SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, IEEE International Conference on
Data Engineering, and ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management; (3) human-computer-interaction related conferences and journals
including ACM sigCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems and
ACM International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces.
Text Visualization Browser provides four different ways to categorize existing
techniques, i.e., categorizing by task (either analysis or visualization), by data to
be visualized, by application domain, and by style of visualization design. However, providing a clear taxonomy with minimum overlap among different technique
categories is difficult. To address this issue, we provide a simple yet clear taxonomy based on development goals and purposes of the existing works. In particular,
we first separate the techniques into two parts, namely, visualization or interaction
technique and various systems developed for different domains by employing these

2.1 Review Scope and Taxonomy

13

techniques. In particular, in terms of visualization technique, we classify related
research into three categories based on goals. These categories include techniques
developed for (1) visualizing document similarity, (2) revealing the content of the
text data, and (3) showing sentiments and emotions. In this way, we discuss different
types of techniques in this book clearly, as well as illustrate their applications and
show examples of using these techniques together for solving application problems
in different domains.
The rest of this chapter and the book is presented by following this taxonomy. We
first briefly review existing techniques and applications in this chapter and describe
the detail of major and important techniques in the subsequent chapters.

2.2 Visualizing Document Similarity
Representing content similarities at the document level is one of the most traditional visualization techniques produced for summarizing document collections.
These visualizations share a similar representation in which documents are visualized as points on a low-dimensional (2D or 3D) visualization plane. The distance
between each pair of points represents the similarities between the corresponding
two documents, and follows the rule of the closer, the more similar. Many similar
techniques have been extensively studied and have been categorized as either (1)
projection-oriented or (2) semantic-oriented.

2.2.1 Projection Oriented Techniques
Projection oriented techniques visualize documents through a dimension reduction
procedure. In these techniques, a document is represented as a bag of words and
formally described by an N -dimensional feature vector. To compute this vector, a
set of most informative words W (|W | = N ) that best differentiates each document (i.e., best captures the features of different documents) is ranked out from the
entire document collection based on “Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF)”. As a well-known numerical statistic method designed to help extractive
word features for document classification [78], the process computes a TF-IDF score
for each word in the document collection. The word with a higher score is considered
to be more informative, i.e., more useful than other words for classifying different
documents. Before computing TF-IDF, stop words are removed and word stems are
extracted to ensure the informativeness of each word and the correctness of the word
frequency calculation in TF-IDF. Based on these words, an N -dimensional feature
vector is produced for a document with each field indicating a word with top-ranking
TF-IDF score and the field value indicating its frequency in the given document.
Based on this feature vector, projection-oriented techniques visualize a document
from the N -dimensional feature space into a 2D or 3D visualization space via a
dimension reduction algorithm.

Fig. 2.2 Comparison of different Non-Linear Projection Techniques (also known as manifold
learning). The results shown in this figure are is produced based on scikit-lear, which illustrates the
results of projecting a “S-shaped” three dimensional dataset (the left most figure) onto a 2D plane.
The visualization results illustrate that how the original distance in 3D space is preserved in a 2D
plane via different algorithms

Generally, the projection oriented techniques can be further separated into (1)
linear projections (i.e., linear dimension reduction) and (2) non-linear projections
(also known as manifold learning or non-linear dimension reduction). Representative techniques in linear projection include Principle Component Analysis (PCA) [51]
and Linear Discriminant Analysis [5]. Both techniques could be formulated in consistent form in which pair-wise distances between data items are maximized and
guided by weights that indicate the importance of separating pairs of points in the
results [58]. These techniques, although effective in terms of computation, usually
fail to capture data similarities when they are non-linear. Therefore, many non-linear
projection techniques have been developed and extensively studied. Existing methods
could be further classified into (1) distance-oriented techniques and (2) probabilistic formulation-based techniques. A comparison of different techniques is shown in
Fig. 2.2.
Specifically, the distance oriented non-linear projection techniques such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) [60] and Locally Linear embedding (LLE) [92] introduce different methods to preserve the distances in the high-dimensional feature
space in a low (2D or 3D) dimensional visualization space. The probabilistic formulation based techniques such as Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) [45] and
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) [73] formulate document similarity via statistical models, in which the similarity between two documents i and
j is captured by the conditional probability of P( j|i) , i.e., given that document i the

2.2 Visualizing Document Similarity

15

probability of document j are in the neighborhood of i in the feature space. Compared with distance oriented techniques, these probabilistic based approaches can be
more effectively computed and can produce results with improved quality [73].

2.2.2 Semantic Oriented Techniques
These approaches represent document similarity via latent topics extracted from
text data. Studies in this direction are mainly inspired by topic modeling techniques
such as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) [46], Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [6], Spherical Topic Model (SAM) [87], and Non-Negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) [64]. Although widely used for analysis, these topic modeling
techniques are not designed for visualization purpose, thereby directly showing the
analysis results is usually difficult for users to interpret. For example, PLSA and LDA
analyze topics in a simplex space which is shown as a triangle on the 2D Euclidean visualization plane. Therefore, these methods cannot display more than three
topics a time (Fig. 2.3d). Semantic oriented techniques have proposed to produce
improved visual representations. These techniques were pioneered by Probabilistic
Latent Semantic Visualization (PLSV ) [47] which embeds the latent topics and docu-

are extracted based on topic modeling. The distances between documents encode their similarities,
following the rule of “the more similar, the closer”. This figure represent visualizations of the same
data, i.e., papers published in NIPS, which was first published in [47]

16

2 Overview of Text Visualization Techniques

ments in the generic Euclidean space at the same time as the distances directly encode
similarities among documents, regarding their shared topics (Fig. 2.3a). Following
this work, other techniques such as Spherical Semantic Embedding (SSE) [63] were
also developed, which provides improved approximations of similarities among documents. When compared to the projection oriented techniques (Fig. 2.3b, c), semantic
based approaches usually produce more meaningful results that are easier for users
to understand.

2.3 Revealing Text Content
Visually representing the content of a text document is one of the most important
tasks in the filed of text visualization. Specifically, visualization techniques have been
developed to show the content of documents from different aspects and at different
levels of details, including summarizing a single document, showing the words and
topics, detecting events, and creating storylines.

2.3.1 Summarizing a Single Document
Existing visualization techniques summarize a document through two main aspects:
(1) content such as words and figures and (2) features such as average sentence length
and number of verbs.
In terms of showing the content of a document, Collins et al. [19] introduce
DocBurst which decompose a document into a tree via its innate structures such
as sections, paragraphs, and sentences that are illustrated in a SunBurst visualization [97] (Fig. 2.4). Rusu et al. [93] visualize the content of a document via a node-link
diagram based on a semantic graph extracted from the document. Strobelt et al. [99]
introduce a system that transforms a document into cards, in which the content of the
document is summarized via keywords and critical figures that are extracted from
the document (Fig. 2.5). Stoffel et al. [98] propose a technique for producing the
thumbnail of a document based on keyword distortion. This technique produces a
focus+context representation of document at the page level. In particular, on each
page of the document, important words are shown in a larger font whereas the rest
ones are suppressed as the context, thereby compressing the entire page into a small
thumbnail without losing the key information of each document page.
Despite the aforementioned studies, document fingerprint [50, 55, 80] is another
typical visualization technique that is developed to summarize a single document.
Instead of showing words and figures, this technique captures the key features of
a document from multiple aspects through a heatmap visualization in which each
cell represents a text block (e.g., a paragraph or a sentence) with color showing
its feature value (Fig. 2.6). A set of linguistic features were used to measure the
document from different aspects, as summarized in [55], including (1) statistical

features such as average word length, average number of syllables per word and
average sentence length, (2) vocabulary features such as the frequencies of specific
words and vocabulary richness measured by Simpson Index, and (3) syntax features
computed based on syntax trees [54].

2.3.2 Showing Content at the Word Level
Directly illustrating the keywords of a document is the most intuitive approach to
present document content. Existing visualization techniques in this category are
largely developed to address three general problems: (1) how to represent the words
esthetically in a visual form to clearly depict the content of the text; (2) how to

2.3 Revealing Text Content

19

summarize and represent the semantic relationships such as “A is B” and “A of
B” between words in the text, and (3) how to reveal word-level patterns such as
repetitions and co-occurrences.
TagCloud [53] is one of the most intuitive and commonly used techniques for
visualizing words. It illustrates a bag of words that summarize the content of the input
text data in a cloud form, in which words, with font size indicating their importance,
are packed together without any overlap. Traditional TagCloud aligns words line
by line, which is most commonly used in webpages to show the content of, for
example, the current web. Different packing strategies will result in various types of
TagClouds [13, 14, 20, 35, 104, 114], among which Wordle is the state-of-the-art
technique that produces aesthetic word packing results by precisely calculating the
word boundary and randomly inserting the word into empty spaces guiding by a
spiral line (Fig. 2.7). Despite these static techniques, dynamic word clouds [24] are
also developed for showing the changes of the text content of a streaming corpus
such as Twitter and publication dataset over time.
Although widely used, TagClouds fail to uncover the word relationship as usually
the words are randomly placed. Therefore, many tree or graph based visualization
techniques are introduced. For example, WordTree [109] (Fig. 2.8) summarizes text
data via a syntax tree in which sentences are aggregated by their sharing words
and split into branches at a place where the corresponding words in the sentences
are divergent. Another example is the PhraseNet [103] (Fig. 2.9). This visualization
employs a node-link diagram, in which graph nodes are keywords and links represent relationships among keywords which are determined by a regular expression
indicated by users. For example, as shown in Fig. 2.9, a user can select a predefined
regular expression from a list to extract a relationship such as “X and / is / of Y” or
by inputting the regular expression by their own.
Despite relationships, visualizations are also developed to illustrate highly detailed
patterns such as word co-occurrences and repetitions [4, 49, 108]. For example,
Wattenberg introduced the Arc diagram (Fig. 2.10), which is one of the earliest visu-

in the box below. This list of patterns simultaneously serves as a legend, a list of presets and an
interactive training mechanism for regular expressions. Here the user has selected X and Y, revealing
two main clusters, one almost exclusively consisting of adjectives, the other of verbs and nouns.
The highlighted clusters of terms have been aggregated by our edge compression algorithm [103]

or sentences) are connected by arcs

alizations designed to illustrate repetition patterns. It represents an input string in a
raw and connects the repeated symbols or words via arcs, thereby illustrating a clear
visual pattern when repetition occurs.

2.3.3 Visualizing Topics
Accompanying the rapid development of topic analysis techniques, visualizing topics
has become a highly interesting research direction in the field of text visualization
in recent years. Compared with word-level visualizations, showing topics helps to
capture more semantics of the data, thereby producing text visualizations that are
easier to interpret. A growing number of visualization techniques are developed to
(1) summarize and explore static topic information, (2) illustrate the topic dynamics
over time, (3) help with topic comparison, and (4) illustrate events and storylines.
Even before the invention of modern topic modeling techniques such as PLSA [46]
and LDA [6], visualization systems such as Topic IslandTM [76] and IN-SPIRETM1
had been introduced to illustrate and explore static topic themes extracted from text
data. Research in this direction is significantly accelerated by the development of
topic analysis techniques. Many attempts have been made to represent the topic
analysis results. In particular, Cao et al. introduced ContexTour [67] (Fig. 2.11),
FacetAtals [17], and SolarMap [15] in a row based on a so-called “multifaceted
entity-relational data model”. In particular, they decompose the text corpus into this
data model based on a series of text analysis approached including (1) topic analysis,
(2) name entity identification, and (3) word co-occurrence detection. The resulting visualization illustrates static topics and their corresponding relationships from

science conferences and journals in 2005 in ContexTour, in which the background contour produces
a density map based on kernel density estimation, showing the underlying distribution of the words.
Topics are shown as TagCoulds on top of the contour map

multiple information facets. Following these works, many similar techniques such
as VisClustering [65] and TopicPanoram [69] were also developed. When compared
to the aforementioned techniques, these works employed similar visual designs and
provided similar functions in terms of topic representation and exploration, but were
developed to focus on different analysis tasks (Fig. 2.12).
Capturing the topic dynamics is another research direction that attracts great attention in the field of text visualization. In particular, ThemeRiever [42] is one of the
earliest techniques developed to show how the frequency of the keywords are changed
over time. It visualizes a set of keywords as stripes (i.e., themes) whose thicknesses
change over time, indicating the change of frequencies of the corresponding keywords, which are shown on top of the stripe. This design was later extended by Liu

i.e. themes, with width indicating the occurrence frequency of keywords at different times

et al. [71] by using strips to represent changing topics, on top of which topic keywords are visualized as TagClouds. Following this research direction, Cui et al. [22]
introduce TextFlow, the state-of-the-art design that captures the dynamics of topic
evolution patterns such as splitting and merging over time. Subsequently, the authors
refined their original design and algorithm to produce a hierarchical topic flow [23]
that supports different levels of detail. This technique precisely captures the topic
evolution patterns as shown in Fig. 2.13. Despite showing the overview of topic evolution trend, visualization techniques were also introduced to capture other temporal
patterns in text data. For example, Gad et al. [34] introduced ThemeDelta, which
integrates with topic modeling algorithms to identify change points when significant
shifts in topics occurred. Liu et al. [68] introduced a technique for exploring topic
lead-lag, i.e. a pattern illustrating how a former topic result in the occurrence of a
latter topic

24

2 Overview of Text Visualization Techniques

When multiple document collections are visualized together at the same time, a
spontaneous analysis task is to compare to find their common and distinct topics.
To this end, many visualization techniques are introduced. Diakopoulos et al. [25]
develop Compare Clouds, which is a TagCloud visualization designed to compare the
topic keywords of two sets of input documents. Oelke et al. [81] also introduce a visual
analysis system for comparing and distinguishing different document collections. In
particular, it detects discriminative and common topics and visualizes each topic in
a circular glyph, in which topic keywords are shown as a TagCloud. Glyphs are laid
out based on topic similarities, i.e., the glyphs of similar topics are placed close to
each other whereas the dissimilar ones are separated apart. In this way, common
topics are placed at the center of the view and the discriminative ones are clearly
separated into different topic regions, thereby forming a visualization that facilitates
topic differentiations and comparisons.

2.3.4 Showing Events and Storyline
Finding topics in a collection of documents is generally a clustering approach. Documents that have similar contents (essentially using similar words) are clustered
together to constitute a topic or a theme. By contrast, event analysis focuses on a different type of information that has time and space as the primary attributes [48]. An
event is generally considered as an occurrence at a given space-time that is perceived
by an observer to have a beginning and an end. Human beings are gifted with the
ability to perceive and make sense of real-world activities as consisting of discrete
events with orderly relations [116]. Thus, when visualizing events, researchers more
focus on understanding the four Ws that characterize these events: who, what, when,
and where.
A large amount of structured or semi-structured textual data explicitly contain
event information, such as crime incidents or accidents recorded by police departments [11, 66], patient records [21, 32, 39, 86, 111–113], and customer purchase
logs [12]. For these datasets, the primary goal of visualization is to provide visual
summaries and to support efficient queries. For example, as an early work, LifeLines [86] provides a general visualization that allows users to explore details
of a patient’s clinical records (Fig. 2.14). A subsequent version, LifeLines2 [106]
enhances the visualization and introduces three general operators, namely, align,
rank, and filter, for interactive exploration of categorical, health-related datasets.
PatternFinder [32] is designed to help users visually formulate queries and find temporal event patterns in medical record datasets. LifeFlow [112] and Outflow [111]
aggregate multiple event sequences into tree or graph visualizations and provide
users with highly scalable overviews (Fig. 2.15).
In real-world situations, people also often segment activities into events at multiple timescales [62]. Small events are grouped to constitute a large and complex event,
such as acts in a play. In addition, events may also share elements, such as participants

duration of clinical events for a patient, such as medical incidents, treatments, and rehabilitation.
Additional information is encoded by the height and color of individual bars. Multiple facets of
the records, such as notes and tests, are stacked vertically, and can be expanded and collapsed as
needed

the 2010–2011 season. Green indicates pathways of winning, while red shows pathways of losing

et al. [12] use a horizontally oriented tree layout to represent the hierarchical relationships of transaction sequences along the timeline. André et al. [2] present Continuum
to visually organize large amounts of hierarchical events and their relationships.

26

2 Overview of Text Visualization Techniques

Recently, significant research has been conducted to extract and explore events
in unstructured textual data, such as news articles [28, 95] and microblogs [26, 75].
Since event information in these data is generally implicit, it requires text mining
techniques, such as topic detection and tracking, are necessary to extract events
for further visualization. For example, EventRiver [72] presents events in a rivermetaphor based on event-based text analysis. In EventRiver visualization, an event
is represented by a bubble that floats on a horizontal river of time. The shape of the
bubble indicates the intensity and duration of the corresponding event. The color
and vertical position of the bubble are used to indicate relationships among different events. Krstajic et al. [59] propose a visualization technique that incrementally
detects clusters and events from multiple time series. To explore events in microblogs,
Marcus et al. [75] describe a visual analytics system that allows users to specify a
keyword of interest, and then visually summarizes events related to the query. DÖrk
et al. [26] also propose an approach called visual backchannel that integrates text,
images, and authors extracted from Twitter data. Their system does not require keywords of interest. Instead, it monitors evolving online discussions on major events,
such as political speeches, natural disasters, and sport games. Twitter posts are summarized as a temporally adjusted stacked graph. Related authors and images are also
visualized as a People Spiral and an Image Cloud, respectively, to help users track the
event evolutions. LeadLine (Fig. 2.16) combines topic analysis and event detection
techniques to extract events from social media data streams. Various information,
such as topic, person, location, and time, is identified to help users reason about the
topic evolutions.
Recently, storyline visualization has emerged and attracted significant attention.
Unlike events and topics that focus on activities and themes, storyline visualizations
switch the focus to entities and relationships between entities. In a typical storyline
visualization, x-axis represents time, and an entity is represented as a line that extends

Fig. 2.16 Screenshot of LeadLine visualization that summarizes CNN news stories from Aug 15,
2011 to Nov 5, 2011. Bottom right locations that are related to President Obama are marked on the
map. Left events that are related to the president are highlighted by color-coded bursts

2.3 Revealing Text Content

horizontally from left to right. The relationships between entities, which may change
over time, are encoded by the vertical distances between the lines. Figure 1.1 shows
an example of such visualizations. The figure shows the main story in the book of
Lord of the Rings. Although this chart is manually made by the author, it inspires a set
of approaches that aim to automatically generate similar visualizations. For example, Ogievetsky [83] builds an online tool to allow users to interactively generate
and adjust a storyline visualization. However, to find a visually satisfying arrangement of lines is the key issue for this visualization. To solve this problem, Ogawa
and Ma [82] raise several criteria and propose a rule-based algorithm to automatically generated a storyline-like visualization to help experts track software evolution
(Fig. 2.18). Later, Tanahashi and Ma [101] further formulate the storyline layout
process as an optimization problem and solve the problem with a genetic method.
Although time-consuming, their algorithm can generate results that are comparable
to those handmade by XKCD. Based on their work, another optimization process
is proposed by Liu et al. [70]; This process is time efficient enough to support realtime interaction and still be able to maintain the same level of aesthetics (Fig. 2.19).
Recently, Tanahashi et al. [100] have extended storyline visualizations to streaming
data, and further provide users with the ability to follow and reason dynamic data.

2.4 Visualizing Sentiments and Emotions
Many visualization techniques have been developed to illustrate the change of sentiments over time regarding to a given streaming text corpus such as news corpus,
review comments, and Twitter streams. This goal can be achieved, as shown in
Fig. 2.20, by showing the sentiment dynamics in a time-series diagram, in which
the time-series curve illustrates the change of sentiment scores computed across
the entire dataset at different time points. However this simple visualization is too
abstract to display information details such as the causes behind the sentiment shifts.
Therefore, many other more advanced techniques have been introduced to illustrate
and interpret the sentiment dynamics from different perspectives.
Most techniques are developed to compute and visualize the sentiments of a focal
group of people based on the text data produced by them. The resulting visualization
forms a “happiness indicator” that captures the sentiment change of the focal group
over time. For example, Brew et al. [9] introduce SentireCrowds, which represents
the sentiment changes of a group of twitter users from the same city in a timeline view

Fig. 2.20 Sentiment Indexing of Twitter data in a time-series diagram. This figure shows that the
public sentiment may change dramatically regarding to different events in our real-life

2.4 Visualizing Sentiments and Emotions

29

and summarizes the potential underlying event that causes the changes in a multi-level
TagCloud designed based on Treemap. Zhao et al. [118] introduce PEARL, which
visualizes the change of a person’s emotion or mood profile derived from his tweets in
a compound belt visualization. The belt groups a set of emotion bands, each indicating
a type of emotion differentiated by colors. The thickness of the band changes over
time, representing the portion of the corresponding emotion at different time. Guzman
et al. [40] visualize the change of emotions of groups of different developers in various
software development projects. Hao et al. [41] analyze sentiments via geo-temporal
term associations based on a streaming dataset of customer’s feedback. Kempter et
al. [57] introduce a fine-grained, multi-category emotion model to classify users’
emotional reactions to public events overtime and to visualize the results in a radar
diagram, called EmotionWatch, as shown in Fig. 2.22.
Despite the preceding visualizations, some visual analysis systems have also been
developed to assist with dynamic sentiment analysis. For example, Wanner et al. [107]
develop a small multiple visualization view to conduct a semi-automatic sentiment
analysis of large news feeds. In this work, a case study on news regarding the US
presidential election in 2008 shows how visualization techniques will help analysts
draw meaningful conclusions without exerting effort to read the content of the news.
Brooks et al. [10] introduce Agave, a collaborative visual analysis system for exploring events and sentiment over time in large Twitter datasets. The system employs
multiple co-ordinated views in which a streamgraph (Fig. 2.21) is used to summarize the changes of the sentiments of a subset of tweets queried based on users’
preferences. Zhang et al. [117] introduce a spacial-temporal view for visualizing the
sentiment scores of micro-blog data based on an electron cloud model intruded in
physics. The resulting visualization maps a single sentiment score to a position inside
a circular visualization display.
More sophisticated systems are also developed to analyze the change of sentiments based on streaming text data. For example, Rohrdantz et al. [91] introduce
a visual analysis system to help users to detect interesting portions of text streams,

Fig. 2.21 Sentiment streamgraphs for the keyword search Flacco, the Super Bowl MVP in a Twitter
dataset using Agave [10]. Negative is red, neutral is gray, and positive is blue. Top overall frequency

set of features extracted from the text. Wang et al. [105] introduce SentiView, which
employs advanced sentiment analysis techniques as well as visualization designs to
analyze the change of public sentiments regarding popular topics on the Internet.
Other systems are designed for analyzing sentiment divergences (i.e., conflicting of
opinions) that occur between two groups of people. For example, Chen et al. [18]
introduce the first work in this topic based on a simple time-series design that summarizes the overall conflicting opinions based on the Amazon review data. Following
this topic, Cao et al. [16] introduce a more advanced technique called SocialHelix,
which extracts two groups of people having the most significant sentiment divergence
over time from Twitter data and illustrates their divergence in a Helix visualization
to show how the divergence occurred, evolved, and terminated.
In terms of application, a large set of such techniques are developed to represent the customer’s sentiments based on the review data. Alper et al. [1] introduce
OpinionBlocks, an interactive visualization tool to improve people’s understanding
of customer reviews. The visualization progressively discloses text information at
different granularities from the keywords to the phrases in which the keywords are
used, and to the reviews containing the phrases. The information is displayed within
two horizontal regions, representing two types (positive and negative) of different
sentiments. Gamon et al. [36] introduce Pulse for mining topics and sentiment orientation jointly from free text customer feedback. This system enables the exploration
of large quantities of customer review data and was used for visually analyzing a
database for car reviews. Through this system, users can examine customer opinion
at a glance or explore the data at a finer level of detail. Oelke et al. [79] analyze to
determine customers’ positive and negative opinions through the comments or rat-

ings posted by the customers. This system visualize the analysis results in a heatmap
view showing both volume of comments and the summarized sentiments (Fig. 2.23).
Wu et al. [115] introduce OpinionSeer, which employs subjective logic [52] to analyze customer opinions on hotel rooms based on their review data inside a simplex
space, which is visualized in a triangle surrounded by context about the customers
such as their ages and their countries of origin. More generic systems are also developed. For example, Wensel [110] introduce VIBES, which extracts the important
topics from a blog, and measures the emotions associated with those topics that
are illustrated through a range of different visualization views. Makki et al. [74]
introduce an interactive visualization to engage the user in the process of polarity
assignment to improve the quality of the generated lexicon used for sentiment or
emotion analysis via minimal user effort.

2.5 Document Exploration Techniques
With a large document collection, how to effectively explore the data to find useful information or insightful data patterns is always a challenge that attracts many
research attentions. Many visualization systems are designed to support an effective
exploration of big text corpus. Many studies are focused on inventing or improving the text data exploration techniques. A large category of them are query-based
systems in which full text indices are built so that users can query to retrieve data
based on their interests. Based on these techniques, many systems are developed to
explore text collected from various application domains. In this section, we review
these exploration techniques as well as their applications.

32

2.5.1 Distortion Based Approaches
As early as the 1990s, some distortion based techniques have been developed to assist
in text data exploration. For example, Robertson and Mackinlay introduced Document Lens [90] which introduced a focus+context design inspired by the magnifier
lens. In this visualization, the focused content of a document is shown in details in
the view center, surrounded by other parts of the content that provides an overall
impression of the text data. Despite showing the content, a similar idea is also used
to visualize documents. For example, Data Mountain [89] employs a focus+context
view based on a prospective projection, in which the focused documents are shown
in a larger size with additional details in front of other documents, whereas the
unfocused ones are shown at the back side in a smaller size (Fig. 2.24). Users can
interactively switch between the focus and context by clicking on the documents.

2.5.2 Exploration Based on Document Similarity
Exploring documents in a similarity view is another early but popular technique that
is extensively used in many text visualizations. These systems, such as InfoSky [3]
and I N -S P I R E TM [44] and ForceSPIRE [31], use an overview that summarizes

2.5 Document Exploration Techniques

33

the entire document collection based on document similarities (see, Sect. 2.1) and
employs a multiple coordinated view to reveal the document details from various
aspects such as keywords and topics. Users can navigate through the similarity view
based on interactions such as zooming and panning, thereby showing different levels
of details [30].

2.5.3 Hierarchical Document Exploration
Exploring big document collection based on hierarchical clustering is another commonly used approach. For example, Paulovich and Minghim introduce HiPP [85],
which lays out documents via a hierarchical circle packing algorithm, in which a
document is shown as a circle. Dou et al. [29], Brehmer et al. [8], as well as PascualCid and Kaltenbrunner [84] develop different types of document exploration systems
that are all based on hierarchical clustering. In these systems, documents are hierarchically clustered based on their topic similarity and the cluster results are shown in
a tree view to guide the data navigation.

2.5.4 Search and Query Based Approaches
Full text search and document query are also widely used to support document
exploration since the very beginning of the text visualization [43, 94, 96]. Instead
of showing a ranked list of related documents regarding the query keywords, most
of the existing visualization techniques transform the search results into a visual
representation to illustrate the insight of content relationships among documents.
Graph layout and projection-based approach are commonly used to represent the
search and query results showing the relationships among documents [7], or text
snippets such as words [88] or collections of topic keywords [33, 37]. More advanced
techniques are also developed. For example, Isaacs introduced Footprints to support
an effective and interactive procedure to retrieve information in a desired subject
from a large document collection. In this system, the topics queried by a user are
visually summarized in an iconic representation as shown in Fig. 2.25. The user can
click the topic to load a collection of related document in the document list and the
content of a selected document can be further shown in the document viewer. A set
of filters also helps users extract the most interesting data.
Exploration in Coordinated Views. The aforementioned document exploration
techniques are usually combined with multiple coordinated visualization views that
illustrate different aspects of the input document collection. Thew views are usually
connected together through interactions such as “Linking and Brushing”.2 In these
2 “The

idea of linking and brushing is to combine different visualization methods to overcome the
shortcomings of single techniques. Interactive changes made in one visualization are automatically

help analysts a retrieve unknown information the goal of query is missing, b track the query results
from multiple aspects to avoid missing important information and help to determine when should
the query procedure be stopped

techniques, topic analysis is one of the most important aspects. For example, Dou
et al. [27] introduce ParallelTopics, which guides the document exploration via multiple views. Specifically, it employs a parallel coordinates to illustrate how a document
distributed in different topics, employs a TagCloud view to illustrate the keywords
inside each topic, and employs the theme river to show the change of topics over
time. Many other similar systems are available, such as Jigsaw [38] and IVEA [102],
which are discussed in details in Chap. 4.

2.6 Summary of the Chapter
In this chapter, we reviewed more than 200 papers in the field of text visualization
to provide an overview. This chapter provides readers a brief idea of what is text
visualization and what is the research focus of this field. In particular, we summarize the existing works into three major categories based on the type of information to be shown in a visualization. Specifically, these techniques include those for
(1) visualizing document similarities, (2) revealing text content, and (3) visualizing
(Footnote 2 continued)
reflected in the other visualizations. Note that connecting multiple visualizations through interactive
linking and brushing provides more information than considering the component visualizations
independently.” [56].

semantics and emotions. We also reviewed the most commonly used text exploration
techniques, including (1) distortion-based approaches, (2) exploration based on document similarity, (3) hierarchical document exploration, (4) search and query-based
approaches, and (5) exploration in coordinated views. In the following chapters, we
focus on detailed techniques.
